# leaf-disease-cnn

This project focuses on building and training Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to address two distinct classification problems:

Leaf Disease Classification: Identifying various diseases in leaves using image data with a TensorFlow CNN.
MNIST Digit Recognition: Recognizing handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using a CNN built from scratch.
The project aims to demonstrate the versatility and effectiveness of CNNs in handling different types of image classification tasks.
